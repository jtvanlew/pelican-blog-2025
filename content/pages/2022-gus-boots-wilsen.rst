The premise
-----------

::

   Designer: *shows Grant Petersen updates on the Gus chainstay*
   Grant: Longer. 
   Designer: L-longer? *nervously stretches chainstay beyond all human obscenity*
   Grant: *nods with malice* Longer.
   Designer: *openly weeps*... *types '56 cm' into Autocad*... *hits enter*... *dies*
   Grant: Perfection.

The bike
--------

I got this big beautiful beast with the original intentions for it to be a dedicated bike camper and with full subscription to the RBW hillibike ethos. And I did of course take it on a couple bike campings and up and down the hills east of town. But it wasn't long before J.Meinte was born and I found the drooping top tube + insane stability of the geometry to be a perfect platform for child transporter. Gus now still goes out most weekends, but now for more chill hillirides with baby on board, down to the park, or as commuter to daycare and/or back.
