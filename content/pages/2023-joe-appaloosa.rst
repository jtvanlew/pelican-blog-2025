The bike
--------
This is my 2023 Rivendell Joe Appaloosa. I love it of course as the style of Riv bike I started dreaming about after reading Riv's readers back in 2008-ish and started hacking my Peugeot. But this bike will hold an extra-special place in my heart; I picked it up from Walnut Creek the day my wife went into labor for our first child. I was in the garage beginning the assembly after work on a Friday when she called to me from the kitchen with what turned out to be the start of her contractions. 

At the time I've writing, I've since taken it on a 60+ mile "green fondo" in Sonoma County, a 3 day camping trip on Catalina Island, fetching dog food and groceries, and all sorts of other rides in the hills east of Fremont.
