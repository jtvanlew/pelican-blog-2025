The bike
--------
I love this bike of course as the final iteration of "Rive-style" bike I'd dreamt about since 2008-ish when I was first hacking my 70s Peugeot to look like what I saw in the Riv Readers. But this bike will hold an extra-special place in my heart in its own right -- I picked it up from Walnut Creek the day my wife went into labor for our first child. I was half-way through assembly in the garage after work on a Friday when she called to me from the kitchen with what turned out to be the start of her contractions. 

At the time I've writing (early 2025), I've since taken it on a 60+ mile "green fondo" in Sonoma County, a 3 day camping trip on Catalina Island, regularly  fetching dog food and groceries, and all sorts of other rides in the hills east of Fremont.
