Small gallery of the team during games in Berkeley and Stanford. As this was the last season of Arizona in the Pac-12, I decided to treat myself to as good of seats as I could get for both venues. 

For the Stanford game this meant second row behind the team bench! I was too excited to have such nice seats so I got there quite a bit too early. I saw Jason Gardner come over to the couches seats and thankfully I had the time to build up the nerve to go up and ask for a photo with him while I was wearing his old jersey.

Interesting aside about that jersey, it was donated by Lute at a silent auction for UA-South in Sierra Vista back in 2006 or 07. My friend Callie's dad was running the auction and whatever it was she did, she made sure I got that damned beautiful jersey. She's a real G and I'll never forget it.

Anyway, I had 2 tickets to the Stanford game because of some last minute snafus, but had no friend to bring so I sat there for 2 full priced front row seats to watch us get absolutely obliterated by a mediocre Cardinal team. c'est la vie I guess.
